# HTML Gallery Generator

[SEE THE RESULT DEMO](http://www.andrejeller.com/HTML_Gallery_Generator/)

This is a simple **.EXE** file for you that whant to make a Static Gallery.

I made this just to use [THIS Freebie](https://tutorialzine.com/2017/02/freebie-4-bootstrap-galleries) in my GitHub Pages. But i was tired of Copy and Past, and than change the image name _in the html file_ one by one. So now you can generate 3 types of gallerys only worrying with the images in your folder.

### Remember:
- The files in the **/images** folder need to be named like img_0, img_1, img_2, ...
- To [Download](https://tutorialzine.com/2017/02/freebie-4-bootstrap-galleries) the CSS options from the [FREEBIE SITE](https://tutorialzine.com/2017/02/freebie-4-bootstrap-galleries). I'll not distribute this files evem if it's 100% free.


One more note:
In the [FREEBIE](https://tutorialzine.com/2017/02/freebie-4-bootstrap-galleries) you have 4 types of CSS. And it can be changed in the final html file. Just look on the line 11 and change it.
If you don't find anything in line 11, Search for this:

`<link rel = 'stylesheet' href = 'css/**fluid-gallery**.css'>`
